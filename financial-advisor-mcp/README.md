# Financial Advisory with AI

This project showcases Exograph's MCP capabilities by modeling a boutique financial advisory company. The model includes entities such as customers, financial advisors, accounts, branches, etc. Each entity also has access control rules such as:
- Customers see only their information and accounts
- Financial managers see only their information and their customers' information, including accounts
- Admins see everything

Follow the instructions in https://exograph.dev/docs/mcp-tutorial to create an MCP server in a couple of commands and talk to the data using natural language.
